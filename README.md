=======

Go samples for PubSubSQL that connect to public PubSubSQL server at public.pubsubsql.com.

To run, open `publisher` and run `go build`. After that just run the publisher using `./publisher`

After that, go into `subscriber`, do a `go build` and run it using `./subscriber` - you should see data coming in!
